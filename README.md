- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheJokingTeen
- 👀 I’m interested in VR Hardware and Software Development, BCI technology, Behavioral Science and Software Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that Windows is not a reliable Operating System
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas on how to create a semi-open ecosystem for the software, hardware and accessibility of a VR platform, with the right to repair at the forefront.
